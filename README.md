# PyBer_Analysis
* Perform analysis ride-sharing data with Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Overview of the analysis
* PyBer is a Python-based ride-sharing app company and our first project is to analysis data using a large number of CSV file and created several types of visualization using different charts that showcased the relationship between the type of cities and the number of drivers and riders, as well as percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. This analysis helped Pyber to improve access to ride-sharing service app and determine affordability for the underserved neighborhood.

* Creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Summary
* From the graph below we can conclude that Urban area has more riders but the average fare is lower, and Ural area have a lower riders but the average fare is higher.
